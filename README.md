# CRISPR against phage

This is some of the code we used for our paper, [*Dynamics of adaptive immunity against phage in bacterial populations*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005486).

This is a *Mathematica* version of the C++ code that generated the figures in the paper. The figures from this code might, therefore, be slightly different from the ones in the paper.
