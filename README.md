# CRISPR against phage

This is some of the code we used for our paper, [*Dynamics of adaptive immunity against phage in bacterial populations*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005486).

This is a *Mathematica* version of the C++ code that generated the figures in the paper. The figures from this code might, therefore, be slightly different from the ones in the paper.

## File guide

The best file to start with is `model_eqns_and_figs.nb`, which contains most of the relevant code, including that necessary for (approximately) reproducing the figures in the paper. The file `paper_model.nb` is almost identical, but contains some earlier attempts that are no longer there in `model_eqns_and_figs.nb`, while on the other hand missing the code for reproducing the figures. The file `fitness_equations.nb` includes some other attempts.
